Q1/- Explain the Entity class life-cycle.
->an entity obj has the 3 life-cycle state:-
1.new state/transient state
2.persistence state/managed state
3.detached state


1.new state/transient state:- 
--if we create a object of persistence class and this class is not attached with the EM obj, then
this stage is known as new state/transient state
Student s=new Student(10,"ram",780);

2.persistence state:- 
--if a persistence class obj or Entity obj is associated with EM obj, then this obj 
will be in persistence state.

ex:-
when we call a persist(-) method by supplying Student entity obj then at time student obj will be in persistence state
or 
when we call find() method and this method returns the Student obj, then that obj will also be in persistence state.

Note:- when an entity class obj is in persisitence state ,it is in-sync with the DB table ,i.e 
any change made on that obj inside the tx area will reflect to the table automatically.
