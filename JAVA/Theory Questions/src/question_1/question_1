Q1>What are the advantages of using Hibernate over JDBC?
-->
1.hibernate is good in mapping data to database using XML files.
So, developer need not write code for this. JDBC supports only  native sql.

2. Hibernate query langage and  supports polymorphic queries also,
it also Supports native sql.

3.Hibernate code will work very well for all databases for ex:-Oracle, MySql,postGragrel. etc.
but JDBC is data Specific.

4.No complete kowlege of sql is needed in hibernate, 
the data can be stored in cache,for better performance,where as in JDBC, the java cache,is To be implemented.
