● Explain difference between JPA and Hibernate.
->
JPA:-
1.JPA is API specifications.
2.JPA define the management ofrelaional data in the java applictions.
3.is is defined in javax.persistence package.
4.The EntityManagerfactory interface is used to interract with entity,
manage factory for the persistence unit, thus is provides an entity manager.
5.it uses Java persistence  query language(JPQL)
as a object oriented query language. to perform database operation.

HIBERNATE:-
1.Hibernate is a framework and one of the implementation f JPA.
2.Hibernate is the one of the ORM tool. Which is used to save the state
of java object into database.
3.it is defined in org.hibermate package.
4.it used Session Factory Interface.
5.it Uses Hibernatequery Language(HQL),
as a object oriented query languae to perform data base operation.

● Explain the Life-cycle of Entity class with example.
-->
three state of hiberate lifecycle:

1.Transient state:
It is initial state of an object,
once we create an instanceof POJO class then the object enters into transient state

2.Persistence state:
As soon As the object associate with with the session it entered into
the persistence state.
Here, each object represents the row of table.

3.Detached State.:
as an object is no more assiciated with the databasechanges done in
object entered into the detached state, detached object still has a represenation in database.
