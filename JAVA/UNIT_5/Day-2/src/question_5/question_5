Q5) Explain Difference between Upper Bounded Wildcards and Lower Bounded Wildcards with Example.
The purpose of upper bounded wildcards is to decrease the restrictions on a variable. It
restricts the unknown type to be a specific type or a subtype of that type. It is used by
declaring wildcard character ("?") followed by the extends (in case of, class) or
implements (in case of, interface) keyword, followed by its upper bound.
Syntax:
List<? extends Number>
here ? is a wildcard character and Number is a predefined java class belongs to
java.lang package.

Lower Bounded Wildcards:
The purpose of lower bounded wildcards is to restrict the unknown type to be a specific
type or a supertype of that type. It is used by declaring wildcard character ("?") followed
by the super keyword, followed by its lower bound.
Day12: Map, Arrays and Collections classes, Iterator, Generics, Queue, Priority Queue 22
Syntax:
List<? super Integer>
Suppose, we want to write the method for the list of Integer and its supertype (like
Number, Object). Using List<? super Integer> is suitable for a list of type Integer or
any of its superclasses whereas List<Integer> works with the list of type Integer only.
So, List<? super Integer> is less restrictive than List<Integer>


Example: specifying the lower bound wildcards to write the method for List<Integer>
and List<Number>.
