Q3/- How many types of relationships exist among tables in the
Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to
establish these relationships among tables with examples.
-->

There are three types of relations exists in databases.
 1.One to One:-
Here, a single row of the first table can only be related to only one records of a second table.
Similarly, the row of a second table can also be related to only one row of the first table.
 
 examples:-
 One family lives in one house, and the house contains one family.
 One person has one passport, and the passport can only be used by one person.
 One person has one ID number, and the ID number is unique to one person.
 
 2.one-to-many:-
 rows of the first table can be related to one or more rows of the second tables, 
 but the rows of second tables can only relate to the only row in the first table.
 
 examples:-
 A car maker makes many different models, but a particular car model is built only by a single car maker.
 A father can have many sons but son have only one father
 
 3.many to many:-
 Each record of the first table can relate to any records (or no records) in the second table. Similarly, each record of the second table can 
 also relate to more than one record of the first table. It is also represented an N:N relationship.
 examples:-
 A user can belong to multiple community, and a community can have multiple users.
