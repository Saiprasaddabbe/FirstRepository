Q1/- Explain the meaning of the deadlock in multithreaded application, when it can occur in
multithreading applications.Write one example of deadlock.

-->
A lock without key is nothing but a deadlock.
Deadlock is a condition happens in java when two synchronised threads are
waiting each other forever. then deadlock happens..
the synchronized keyword is the main reason for deadlock condition.

example for deadlock:

class A extends Thread{
@Override
void run(){
synchronized(this){
this.wait();
this.notify();
}

}

}
class B extends Thread{

@Override
void run(){
synchronized(this){
this.wait();
this.notify();
}
}
class Main{

public static void main(String[] args){
Thread t1 = new Thread(new A());
Thread t2 = new Thread(new B());
t1.start();
t2.start();

}

}

In the above condition deadlock will happen...!
