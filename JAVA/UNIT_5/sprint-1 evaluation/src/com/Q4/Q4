Output will be = ACE;

first try block will be execute, then in console print "A";
next line is int num = 99/0; //this will give Arithmetic Exception because we cannot divide with Zero.
so control will go to catch block where arithmetic exception will get catch and console print "C";
then control direct jump to last line of main i.e //printing "E";
