Q3>What is exception handling in java, Write the hierarchy of Exception class and, Mention some
of the predefined Exception classes at least 5, and the reason when those exception class
object is generated in our application.

Exception Handling in Java is one of the effective means to handle the runtime errors so that the regular flow of the 
application can be preserved. Java Exception Handling is a mechanism to handle runtime errors such as ClassNotFoundException,
IOException, SQLException, RemoteException, etc.

Exception is an unwanted or unexpected event, which occurs during the execution of a program, i.e. at run time, 
that disrupts the normal flow of the programâ€™s instructions. Exceptions can be caught and handled by the program.
When an exception occurs within a method, it creates an object. This object is called the exception object.
It contains information about the exception, such as the name and description of the exception and the state of the 
program when the exception occurred.
